# Getting Started

The easiest way to get up and running is to clone this repository!

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

This template is already set up with the vercel adapter. You can change the adapter in the svelte.config.js file. Check out the [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) docs for more info.
